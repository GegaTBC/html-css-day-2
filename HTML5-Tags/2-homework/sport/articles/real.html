			Real Madrid Club de Fútbol (Spanish pronunciation: [reˈal
			maˈðɾið ˈkluβ ðe ˈfuðβol] (About this soundlisten), meaning
			Royal Madrid Football Club), commonly referred to as Real
			Madrid, is a Spanish professional football club based in
			Madrid. Founded on 6 March 1902 as Madrid Football Club,
			the club has traditionally worn a white home kit since
			inception. The honorific title real is Spanish for "royal"
			and was bestowed to the club by King Alfonso XIII in 1920
			together with the royal crown in the emblem. The team has
			played its home matches in the 81,044-capacity Santiago
			Bernabéu Stadium in downtown Madrid since 1947. Unlike most
			European sporting entities, Real Madrid's members (socios)
			have owned and operated the club throughout its history.
			The club was estimated to be worth €3.8 billion ($4.2
			billion) in 2019, and it was the second highest-earning
			football club in the world, with an annual revenue of
			€757.3 million in 2019.[6][7] The club is one of the most
			widely supported teams in the world.[8] Real Madrid is one
			of three founding members of La Liga that have never been
			relegated from the top division since its inception in
			1929, along with Athletic Bilbao and Barcelona. The club
			holds many long-standing rivalries, most notably El Clásico
			with Barcelona and El Derbi Madrileño with Atlético Madrid.
			Real Madrid established itself as a major force in both
			Spanish and European football during the 1950s, winning
			five consecutive European Cups and reaching the final seven
			times. This success was replicated in the league, which the
			club won five times in the space of seven years. This team,
			which included Alfredo Di Stéfano, Ferenc Puskás, Francisco
			Gento, and Raymond Kopa, is considered by some in the sport
			to be the greatest team of all time.[9][10][11]
