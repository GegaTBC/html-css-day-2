			Arsenal Football Club is a professional football club based
			in Islington, London, England. Arsenal plays in the Premier
			League, the top flight of English football. The club has
			won 13 league titles (including one unbeaten title), a
			record 14 FA Cups, two League Cups, 16 FA Community
			Shields, the League Centenary Trophy, one European Cup
			Winners' Cup, and one Inter-Cities Fairs Cup. Arsenal was
			the first club from the South of England to join the
			Football League, in 1893, and they reached the First
			Division in 1904. Relegated only once, in 1913, they
			continue the longest streak in the top division,[6] and
			have won the second-most top-flight matches in English
			football history.[7] In the 1930s, Arsenal won five League
			Championships and two FA Cups, and another FA Cup and two
			Championships after the war. In 1970–71, they won their
			first League and FA Cup Double. Between 1989 and 2005, they
			won five League titles and five FA Cups, including two more
			Doubles. They completed the 20th century with the highest
			average league position.[8] Herbert Chapman, who changed
			the fortunes of Arsenal forever, won the club its first
			silverware, and his legacy led the club to dominate the
			1930s decade; Chapman, however, died of pneumonia in 1934,
			aged 55. He helped introduce the WM formation, floodlights,
			and shirt numbers;[9] he also added the white sleeves and
			brighter red to the club's jersey.[10] Arsène Wenger is the
			longest-serving manager and won the most trophies. He won a
			record seven FA Cups, and his title-winning team set an
			English record for the longest top-flight unbeaten league
			run at 49 games between 2003 and 2004,[11] receiving the
			nickname The Invincibles.
