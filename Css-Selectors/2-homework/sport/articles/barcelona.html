			Futbol Club Barcelona (Catalan pronunciation: [fubˈbɔl
			ˈklub bəɾsəˈlonə] (About this soundlisten)), commonly
			referred to as Barcelona and colloquially known as Barça
			([ˈbaɾsə]), is a Spanish professional football club based
			in Barcelona, Spain, that competes in La Liga, the top
			flight of Spanish football. Founded in 1899 by a group of
			Swiss, Spanish, and English footballers led by Joan Gamper,
			the club has become a symbol of Catalan culture and
			Catalanism, hence the motto "Més que un club" ("More than a
			club"). Unlike many other football clubs, the supporters
			own and operate Barcelona. It is the fourth-most valuable
			sports team in the world, worth $4.06 billion, and the
			world's richest football club in terms of revenue, with an
			annual turnover of €840.8 million.[2][3] The official
			Barcelona anthem is the "Cant del Barça", written by Jaume
			Picas and Josep Maria Espinàs.[4] Barcelona traditionally
			play in dark shades of blue and red stripes, leading to the
			nickname Blaugrana. Domestically, Barcelona has won a
			record 74 trophies: 26 La Liga, 31 Copa del Rey, thirteen
			Supercopa de España, three Copa Eva Duarte, and two Copa de
			la Liga titles, as well as being the record holder for the
			latter four competitions. In international club football,
			the club has won twenty European and worldwide titles: five
			UEFA Champions League titles, a record four UEFA Cup
			Winners' Cups, a joint record five UEFA Super Cups, a
			record three Inter-Cities Fairs Cups, and three FIFA Club
			World Cups.[5] Barcelona was ranked first in the
			International Federation of Football History & Statistics
			Club World Ranking for 1997, 2009, 2011, 2012, and
			2015[6][7] and as of 2021, occupies the fourth position on
			the UEFA club rankings.[8] The club has a long-standing
			rivalry with Real Madrid, and matches between the two teams
			are referred to as El Clásico.
